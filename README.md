### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Myrachanto here

I am a full-stack web developer with more than two years of experience in Golang, but overall I have being coding since 2017
Being a backend developer is my forte especially working with Golang to build both monoliths and micro service apps
Hexagonal architecture , domain-driven architecture(DDD), or model-view architecture are some of the architectures I work with.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about GRPC and RPC(remote procedure call)-am still mastering the technology
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about multithreading with golang
Echo framework, Gorm, Expressjs are just a few of the frameworks I utilized while coding

As front end web developer I love working with Vuejs and its supporting technologies such as Vuex, Vuetify, Vue router, Nuxtjs, tailwind CSS- e-commerce client

here is an URL to the GitHub repository to my eCommerce back end built in Golang to support CMS

I utilize both SQL (MySQL) and NoSQL(MongoDB) databases.
I have built several custom e-commerce shopping websites with Nuxtjs, and tailwind.
