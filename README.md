### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Myrachanto here

I am a full-stack web developer(golang and vuejs) with more than three years of experience in Golang, but overall I have being coding since 2017
Being a backend developer is my forte especially working with Golang to build both monoliths and micro service apps.

In the recent past I have added DevOps to my skillset, this implying that i can now work with, docker, docker-compose, kubernetes, terraform, ansible, AWS among other DevOps tools.

Hexagonal architecture , domain-driven architecture(DDD), or model-view architecture are some of the architectures I work with.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about GRPC and RPC(remote procedure call)-am still mastering the technology
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently mastering about multithreading with golang
- ðŸŒ± I am also learning Blockchain with golang

Echo framework, Gorm, Expressjs are just a few of the frameworks I utilized while coding

As front end web developer I love working with Vuejs and its supporting technologies such as Vuex, Vuetify, Vue router, Nuxtjs, tailwind CSS- e-commerce client
